# Automation Project
The project is performed on Sauce Labs platform (www.saucedemo.com) which allows you to purchase clothes online by adding items to your shopping cart, filling in your personal details and making shipping.

The goal is to extract Sauce Labs platform usability and features and build a solid automation infrastructure in JAVA that tests all use-cases and creates elaborate reports about tested features.
